    "For updating the road, we also use a `where` but note that we have used the simpler (commented out) version from the original Python code as a single `where` can only implement a single `if`, `then`, `else` construct. To compute the number of moves we count the number of differences between the new and old roads, but note that we have divide this by two as it counts *both* a car entering and a car leaving a cell."
