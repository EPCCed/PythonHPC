    "Here is the main program. Note that with these default parameters it will take a **long** time (several minutes) to run, but we will use this length of road for the numpy examples so it is worth running it at least once. The slightly strange value for `ncell` is because, when we run in parallel, we will require that the `ncell` is an exact multiple of the number of processes we use (just for simplicity). The number of processes is often a power of two, so this value lets us run on process counts from 1, 2, 4, ..., 2048, 4096 on ARCHER2. On your laptop I would not recommend using more than 8 processes!\n",
