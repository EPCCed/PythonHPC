    "# Library functions\n",

    "The library functions are *exactly* the same as for the serial numpy version. If you write MPI code carefully, the parallelisation need not affect all of the code base. As here, you are often able to use the same routines to do the serial work (i.e. where there is no communications). The speedup comes because each process is operating on a smaller length of road, i.e. the value of `n` will be smaller here.\n",
    "\n",
    "`gettime` and `updatebcs` are no longer required as MPI has its own timer and the boundary values are now exchanged between processes using send and receive operations, but they are left it in as we want to use the same file as for the serial code."
